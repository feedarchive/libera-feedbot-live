r/science:15+,"[Neuroscience] Infusing the brains of aged mice with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken from young mice can improve memory function, suggests a new study. The research suggests that the cognitive benefits of the CSF transfer may be due to increases in the population of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs).",https://redd.it/unbtjm,
