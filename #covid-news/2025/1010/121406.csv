PubMed,"[Turk Psikiyatri Derg] Group Therapies for Gender Minority Stress: Systematic Review and Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy Process PresentationGender minority stress refers to the form of stress experienced by individuals who identify as trans or within the spectrum of gender diversity due to discriminatory discourses and actions in society. This type of stress can negatively affect both mental and physical health and may even result in the loss of one's most fundamental right-the right to life. Therefore, it is crucial for professionals to remain sensitive to gender minority stress when working clinically with this population. This article aims to raise awareness among mental health professionals about gender minority stress and to provide a practical example of an intervention in this area. To this end, group therapy models addressing gender minority stress were reviewed through a systematic literature search. In addition, the experiences of eight individuals who participated in a group therapy designed and facilitated by the authors using an affirmative cognitive behavioral approach were shared. The findings indicate that the most prominent intervention models in the literature targeting gender minority stress are based on cognitive behavioral group therapy. Furthermore, it was observed that members who participated in the group therapy developed psychosocial empowerment through gaining awareness, solidarity, and cognitive and behavioral skills related to self-regulation.Keywords: Cognitive behavioral therapy, gender identity, group therapyCinsiyet Kimliği Azınlık Stresine Yönelik Grup Terapileri: Sistematik Gözden Geçirme ve Olumlayıcı Bilişsel Davranışçı Grup Terapi Süreci Sunumu2Koray BAŞAR1, Halil PAK2, K.
